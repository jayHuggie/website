## About
Hey! My name is Jae Hyuk Lee (you can call me Joseph). Iâ€™m studying Mathematics and Computer Science at UC San Diego and graduating in June 2024. I am deeply passionate about Computer Graphics, where Math and CS converge powerfully. From constructing basic OpenGL scenes to developing my own Path-Tracing Graphics engine using CUDA, my enthusiasm for the field is rapidly growing and I dream to work in this field one day. I have no prior work experience, but I am determined to expand my interest even further through my first internship in Computer Graphics.
