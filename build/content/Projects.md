## Animation with Dynamic Cubemap
A character animation system with skeleton loading, skinning, and keyframe animation. It also includes static and dynamic cubemaps for environment mapping, real-time reflections, and basic Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, all developed with OpenGL and GLSL.
